# Primitive Types vs Reference Types

## Primitive Types:
1. Stored in **stack**.
2. Passed or assigned by value (**call by value**).
3. Changes to copies don't affect the original.

## Reference Types:
1. Stored in **heap**; accessed via references (stored in stack).
2. Changing the value through another reference affects the original.
