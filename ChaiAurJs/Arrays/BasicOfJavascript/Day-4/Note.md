In comparison, when you compare two string values, two integer values, or two boolean values, it’s relatively straightforward. However, complications arise when comparing values of different types. For example, when you compare a string value with an integer, the string value will first be converted to an integer, and then the comparison will occur. 

### Example
If you compare `"2"` and `2` in the condition `"2" == 2`, it will output `true`.

As we know, the main goals in programming are to write clean, readable code. Therefore, complex comparisons—such as comparing `null` and `undefined` to other values—should generally be avoided.

In `==`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, and `>=` comparisons, equality and comparison operators behave differently:
- Comparisons (`<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`) convert `null` to a number, which is `0`.
- Equality (`==`) does not perform this conversion.

For example:
- When you compare `null >= 0`, the output will be `true` because `null` is converted to `0`.
- When you check `null == 0`, the output will be `false`.

### Strict Equality Check
There is also a strict equality check, known as triple equals (`===`). In this case, the comparison considers both value and type. 

For example:
- When you check `"2" == 2`, the output will be `true`.
- When you check `"2" === 2`, the output will be `false` because it checks both the value and the type.
