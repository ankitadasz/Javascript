JavaScript has several fundamental data types, including:

1. **Number**  
   Used for numeric values, e.g., `23`, `45`.

2. **String**  
   Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., `"arrangement of characters"`.

3. **Boolean**  
   Represents logical values: `true` or `false`.

4. **Null**  
   A standalone value indicating "no value," with a type of `object`.

5. **Undefined**  
   Used for a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value, with a type of `undefined`.

6. **Object**  
   A complex data structure used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

### Additional Data Types Introduced in Newer Versions

- **Symbol (ES6)**  
  Introduced for creating unique identifiers, ensuring uniqueness.

- **BigInt (ES2020)**  
  Used for storing very large numbers beyond the range of `Number`. Commonly used in applications such as **Reddit** or **Figma**.

### Strict Mode

`"use strict"` is a directive that enables JavaScriptâ€™s strict mode, which enforces more secure coding practices and enables certain ES6+ features, ensuring compatibility with newer versions of JavaScript.
