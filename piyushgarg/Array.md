when you declare an array with the variable const you can change the value of the array in future but how is it possible as we know that when you declare a varibale with const its immutable?
so its right you cant change the const variable but you can change the inside value of it


to push a value iside an array you can use array.push it will store the value at the last index of the array

in languages like c++,java you can store simillar datatype,so its homogenious,but in js yu can store different dataype variable so its heterogenious

when you want to know the index value of an element in array you can consolelog the arra.indexof(the element)
if the value gives -1 then the element is not present if it gives some value in +ve the element is present at that index
