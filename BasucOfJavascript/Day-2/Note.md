JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript has several fundamental data types, including:

Number
Used for numeric values, e.g., 23, 45.

String
Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "arrangement of characters".

Boolean
Represents logical values: true or false.

Null
A standalone value indicating "no value," with a type of object.

Undefined
Used for a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value, with a type of undefined.

Object
A complex data structure used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

Additional Data Types Introduced in Newer Versions
Symbol (ES6)
Introduced for creating unique identifiers, ensuring uniqueness.

BigInt (ES2020)
Used for storing very large numbers beyond the range of Number. Commonly used in applications such as Reddit or Figma.

Strict Mode
"use strict" is a directive that enables JavaScriptâ€™s strict mode, which enforces more secure coding practices and enables certain ES6+ features, ensuring compatibility with newer versions of JavaScript.

Type Conversion in JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can convert between different data types. For example:

To convert a number to a string:

javascript
Copy code
let num = 9;
let stringNum = String(num);
This converts the number 9 to a string.

Similarly, you can convert a string to a number or a boolean as needed:

String to Number: Number("10")
String to Boolean: Boolean("true")
